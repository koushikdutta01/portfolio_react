# Fedora Linux: The Developer's Choice

Switching to Fedora 43 was the best move for my productivity. Here is why:

## 1. Bleeding Edge but Stable
You get the latest kernel and packages (essential for Java 21+ and the latest Docker engines) without the instability of Arch.

## 2. Terminal-First Workflow
Using **Zsh + Starship** makes the terminal not just a tool, but a beautiful environment. 

## 3. Automation
I automated my entire system backup using simple shell scripts that sync my VS Code settings and GNOME configurations to GitLab.
